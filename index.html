        The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is a 2006 action film directed by Justin Lin and written by Chris Morgan.
        It is the standalone sequel to 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) and is the third installment in the Fast & Furious
        franchise. The film stars Lucas Black, Bow Wow, Nathalie Kelley, Sung Kang, and Brian Tee. In the film, high
        school car enthusiast Sean Boswell is sent to live in Tokyo with his estranged father and finds solace exploring
        the city's drifting community with Han Lue.

        A third film was confirmed in June 2005, when Lin was selected as director. Morgan was hired following an open
        call that summer; the pair faced creative differences with producers throughout the film's production, which led
        to discussions over releasing Tokyo Drift direct-to-video. Unable to secure the returns of the original cast,
        developers sought to establish the film as a distinct entry in the franchise, with more emphasis on car culture
        and street racing.[6] Principal photography began in August 2005 and lasted until that November, with filming
        locations including Los Angeles and Tokyo, the first film in the franchise to feature an international filming
        location.

        Tokyo Drift is the first to begin the franchise's longtime association with Lin, Morgan, and composer Brian
        Tyler, who would either return for the subsequent main installments.[7] The film features a cameo appearance by
        Vin Diesel, who reprises his role as Dominic Toretto, and it retroactively serves as a soft continuation of
        Better Luck Tomorrow (2002), Lin's debut film which also starred Kang in the same role.[8]

        The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift was released in the United States on June 16, 2006. The film received
        mixed reviews with praise for its driving sequences, but criticism for its screenplay and acting performances.
        It grossed over $158 million worldwide, becoming the lowest-grossing film in the franchise, which left the
        future of the series in limbo.[9] The fourth installment, Fast & Furious, was released in April 2009.
