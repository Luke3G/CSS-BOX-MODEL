            The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is a 2006 action film directed by Justin Lin and written by Chris
            Morgan.
            It is the standalone sequel to 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) and is the third installment in the Fast & Furious
            franchise. The film stars Lucas Black, Bow Wow, Nathalie Kelley, Sung Kang, and Brian Tee. In the film, high
            school car enthusiast Sean Boswell is sent to live in Tokyo with his estranged father and finds solace
            exploring
            the city's drifting community with Han Lue.

            A third film was confirmed in June 2005, when Lin was selected as director. Morgan was hired following an
            open
            call that summer; the pair faced creative differences with producers throughout the film's production, which
            led
            to discussions over releasing Tokyo Drift direct-to-video. Unable to secure the returns of the original
            cast,
            developers sought to establish the film as a distinct entry in the franchise, with more emphasis on car
            culture
            and street racing.[6] Principal photography began in August 2005 and lasted until that November, with
            filming
            locations including Los Angeles and Tokyo, the first film in the franchise to feature an international
            filming
            location.

            Tokyo Drift is the first to begin the franchise's longtime association with Lin, Morgan, and composer Brian
            Tyler, who would either return for the subsequent main installments.[7] The film features a cameo appearance
            by
            Vin Diesel, who reprises his role as Dominic Toretto, and it retroactively serves as a soft continuation of
            Better Luck Tomorrow (2002), Lin's debut film which also starred Kang in the same role.[8]

            The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift was released in the United States on June 16, 2006. The film received
            mixed reviews with praise for its driving sequences, but criticism for its screenplay and acting
            performances.
            It grossed over $158 million worldwide, becoming the lowest-grossing film in the franchise, which left the
            future of the series in limbo.[9] The fourth installment, Fast & Furious, was released in April 2009.
